                            This was our second ROBOCON and we were determined to improve. We were still an infant society but what we lacked in experience we more than make up in power of sheer will.

                            Our efforts finally brought fruit in 2018 and we got quite a big improvement in rank. We surpassed teams which had much more experience and resources and this was the year Robotics Society NITH finally shine through.

                            Techkriti is one of the biggest techfest in India which has many robotics related competitions and we made many projects for the same. Although some of our projects lost points due to some technicalities but the organizers were so &nbsp;impreesed by our projects they awarded one team with a summer internship.

                            In ADVITIYA, we participated in many events like Line follower, RoboSoccer, MicroMouse and many more and we got appreciation too. Although some of our projects lost points due to some technicalities.
